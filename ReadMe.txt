FindMe 1.0

The app should allow users to share their location with friends and family. Users have to sign up before they can access the app. Main features of the app:
- User can Registe
- User can Login
- User can see their friends locations on the map(when available) 
- User can share his/her location with selected list of friends
- User can invite new friends
- User can accept and decline friend requests
- User can see friends list, sent invites and pending requests in the Friends section (only when available)
- User can see his/her profile and history of shared locations. The locations are saved locally and are not synced with user account. This was done intentionally and it much change in the future.

The app is using self hosted Parse backend that was designed and developed for the purpose of this app.

Currently there is no expiry time for locations shared by users. This will be changed to 30 minutes in the future update. 

The app is using CocoaPods dependencies. After cloning the project please navigate to the project directory and update and then install required pods using ‘pod update’ and ‘pod install’ commands.
